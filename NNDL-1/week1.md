# What is a Neural Network?

A linear regression function to predict the price of ie. a house. Can be viewed as the simplest
form of a neural network.

```
 -> input -> |neuron| -> prediction
```
A RELU is a Rectified Linear Unit

By staking together a bunch of Neurons you can predict something with more inputs.

# Supervised Learning
The more popular kind of NN learning.

There are different types of NN:
  - Standard NN - realstate (home features -> price)
  - Convolutional NNs - ussually used for audio applications
  - Recurrent NN - Used in secuential data ie. speach played over time
  - you can combine all these to solve a hard problem ie. autonomous driving

Data can be `Structured` or `Unstructured`.

* Structured: Database data or Spreadsheets - Easy for computers
* Unstructured: Images or Audio  - Easy for Humans

Thanks to NN Unstructured data is easier for computers to understand Unstructured data

# Why is deep learning just taking off?

The amount of (labeled) data has skyroketed with the digital age. 
And so has the performance and size NNs. Moreover the algorithms have been changing over time (RELU)

(m) -> Size of the training set (data)

Training a NN is an interative process: 

```
 -> Idea -> Code -> Experiment -> (round the loop)
```
