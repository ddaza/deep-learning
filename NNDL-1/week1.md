# What is a Neural Network?

A linear regression function to predict the price of ie. a house. Can be viewed as the simplest 
form of a neural network. 

```
 -> input -> |neuron| -> prediction
```
A RELU is a Rectified Linear Unit

By staking together a bunch of Neurons you can predict something with more inputs.
