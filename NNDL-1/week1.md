# What is a Neural Network?

A linear regression function to predict the price of ie. a house. Can be viewed as the simplest
form of a neural network.

```
 -> input -> |neuron| -> prediction
```
A RELU is a Rectified Linear Unit

By staking together a bunch of Neurons you can predict something with more inputs.

# Supervised Learning
The more popular kind of NN learning.

There are different types of NN:
  - Standard NN - realstate (home features -> price)
  - Convolutional NNs - ussually used for audio applications
  - Recurrent NN - Used in secuential data ie. speach played over time
  - you can combine all these to solve a hard problem ie. autonomous driving

Data can be `Structured` or `Unstructured`.

* Structured: Database data or Spreadsheets - Easy for computers
* Unstructured: Images or Audio  - Easy for Humans

Thanks to NN Unstructured data is easier for computers to understand Unstructured data
