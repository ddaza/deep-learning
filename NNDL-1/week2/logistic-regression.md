## Logistic Regression

This is a learning algorithm that you use when the output labels Y in a supervised learning problem are all either 0 or 1 (binary classification problems).

Given an X set we want to know what is the probability of `Y = 1` for each X where the result `0 =< Y(hat) =<1`

And Y(hat) is equal to the `sigmoid` function of a linear approximation that is aproximated to be 0 or 1

W -> corresponds to weights put on the x (NN weights)
b -> the offset of the linear formula.
